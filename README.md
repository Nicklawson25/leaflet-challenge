# leaflet-challenge
# Objective
The goal of this project is to build an interactive map to visualize USGS earthquake data using Leaflet.js. This map will display earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths, making it easy for users to understand and explore the data.

# Repository Setup
Create a new repository named leaflet-challenge.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Inside the repository, create two directories:
Leaflet-Part-1
Leaflet-Part-2
Add necessary HTML and JavaScript files to these directories.
Push all changes to GitHub.

# Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
Steps:
Obtain the Dataset:

Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed to access real-time earthquake data.
Choose a dataset to visualize, such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."
Use the provided GeoJSON URL to retrieve earthquake data.
Create the Map:

Use Leaflet to build a map that plots earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
Marker size will represent earthquake magnitude, and marker color will represent depth.
Earthquakes with larger magnitudes will have bigger markers, while deeper earthquakes will appear darker in color.
Add Interactivity:

Implement popups to display more detailed information when a marker is clicked.
Include a legend to explain the visual elements of your map.

# Conclusion
This challenge helps to create an interactive earthquake visualization tool, improving USGSâ€™s ability to display earthquake data in a meaningful way for both educational and advocacy purposes.
